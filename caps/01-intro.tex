OMNet++ is a ``OMNeT++ is an extensible, modular, component-based C++ simulation library and framework, primarily for building network simulators''. Although OMNeT++ is not a simulator by itself, it assembles different components to perform simulations on network models.

OMNeT++ is made up of the following main components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulation kernel library. It provides functions to extend model capabilities.
    \item Network Description (NED) language. Used to describe the topology of the network.
    \item Simulation IDE. It is based on Eclipse.
    \item Qtenv. It is an interactive simulation runtime GUI.
    \item Cmdenv. It is a CLI for simulation.
    \item Utilities.
    \item Documentation.
\end{itemize}
